# Solitaire Game ReadMe

## Getting Started

This ReadMe file provides you with the necessary information to start developing the Solitaire game using Java and the Swing package in Eclipse. Follow the steps below to set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** You need Java JDK 17 installed on your system. You can download the latest version of JDK from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

- **Eclipse IDE:** You can download Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from the [official Eclipse website](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning the Solitaire game repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. **Open Eclipse:** Launch Eclipse IDE on your computer.

3. Open Your Project:
        Click on File -> Open Projects from File System.
        Navigate to the root directory where you cloned the Solitaire game repository and select it.
        Click Finish.

4. Configure Java Build Path:
        Right-click on the project in the Project Explorer.
        Select Build Path -> Configure Build Path.
        Under the Libraries tab, make sure the JRE System Library points to your installed JDK.

5. Run the Game:
        Locate the Main class within your project (usually named SolitaireMain.java or similar).
        Right-click on the Main class and select Run As -> Java Application.

6. Start Developing: You are now ready to start developing and improving the Solitaire game. Explore the code, make changes, and test your modifications within Eclipse.

## Using Jira as a Kanban Board

Jira is a powerful project management and issue tracking tool that you can use as a Kanban board to manage tasks and project progress.
Prerequisites

Before using Jira as a Kanban board, ensure that you have:

- Jira Account: You should have access to a Jira instance. If not, you can sign up for a Jira Cloud account or check with your organization's Jira administrator for access.

- Java 17: Ensure that you have Java 17 installed on your system. You can download and install the latest Java 17 from the official Oracle website.

### Accessing an Existing Jira Project

1. Log in to Jira: Go to the Jira website and log in with your Jira account credentials.

2. Navigate to the Kanban Board:
  Once logged in, you can access an existing Jira project.
  If you're already part of a project, you'll typically find the Kanban board by clicking on your project's name or by selecting "Boards" in the left sidebar.

3. Using the Kanban Board:
  The Kanban board represents your project's workflow as a series of columns, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
  Tasks or issues are represented as cards that move across the board from left to right as they progress through the workflow.
  You can drag and drop cards between columns to update their status.

### Creating New Issues on the Kanban Board

To create new tasks or issues on your Kanban board:

1. Navigate to the Kanban Board: Access your Kanban board as described above.

2. Create a New Issue:
  On the board, you'll typically find an option to create a new issue or task.
  Click on "Create Issue" or a similar button.
  Fill in the necessary details for your issue, such as a title, description, and assignee.
  Optionally, you can set a due date and priority.

3. Add the Issue to a Column: After creating the issue, it will usually appear in a column corresponding to its initial status (e.g., "To Do").

4. Updating Issue Status:
    As work progresses on the issue, you can drag and drop it between columns to update its status.
    For example, you can move an issue from "To Do" to "In Progress" when you start working on it and then to "Done" when it's completed.

### Collaborating and Tracking Progress

Jira provides several features for collaboration and progress tracking:

- Assigning Issues: You can assign issues to team members by specifying the assignee when creating or editing an issue.

- Adding Comments: You can add comments to issues to provide updates, ask questions, or provide additional information.

- Customizing Workflows: Depending on your project's needs, you can customize the Kanban board's columns and workflow to match your development process.

- Filters and Queries: Use Jira's query language (JQL) to create custom filters and generate reports to track progress and monitor specific aspects of your project.

- Integration: Jira offers numerous integrations with other development tools, enabling you to connect your Kanban board to your development environment seamlessly.
